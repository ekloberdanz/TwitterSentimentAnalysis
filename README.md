# TwitterSentimentAnalysis

This project explores sentiment analysis using Twitter data. It uses various text vectorization techniques (e.g.: one hot, TF-IDF)
to represent tweets and several models to predict the sentiment of tweets (i.e.: positive or negative). The best performing model
is a stacked LSTM architecture.Text pre-processing is multi-threaded to increase speed.
